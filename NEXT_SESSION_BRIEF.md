# M8 Next Session Brief — Session-59 Close

## 🧭 NEXT DIRECTION (Muhammad, 2026-06-25) — "the turning point": DEEPER meaning-based routing
He wants the meaning-based routing (the B-152 arbiter) **extended past wallet⇄fleet to ALL
domains** (tasks, notes, docs, memory, web, chat) — decide the lane by MEANING, not keywords,
everywhere. Calls it a likely turning point. **HARD constraint: stay under FREE quota.** He
OK'd adding **free** APIs if they help (e.g. free embeddings). Recommended path (council-aligned):
generalize `arbitrate()` into a full domain classifier built from a CAPABILITY_REGISTRY
(GPT's anti-drift point), LLM consulted only on contest/miss (free Groq/Gemini), and OPTIONALLY
add **pgvector embeddings** (free on his Supabase) + a **free embedding model** (Gemini
text-embedding-004 free tier) for "novel phrasing → nearest known intent" recall. The arbiter
already LOGS decisions to `m8_router_misses` lane=`arbiter:*` → his live testing now BUILDS the
real dataset that should drive this. Do AFTER he confirms B-152/153/154 live. See
`TEAM_ROUND_ROUTING_2026-06-25_RESPONSES.md` (§4 cascade, §5 incremental rollout).

**✅ DEPLOYED — Build-154 currency-context follow-up (prod `e55e46d`):** two live-caught fixes —
(A) "i want to see the amounts in sar" drifted to FLEET (arbiter now prefers the MOST-RECENT
turn: last turn wallet ⇒ lean wallet even if a fleet brief is still in the window; + "amounts/
see/want … in <cur>" now counts as a convert request); (B) "convert to sar" converted the whole
HOUSEHOLD not Sara (breakdown header "Sara's TOP spending" broke member capture → allow "top" +
possessive converted header). Tests build152 36/36, build153 28/28, adjacent 40/40. 🔴 pending his live re-test.

**✅ DEPLOYED — Build-153 single-currency wallet view (prod `33bc213`):** merged 2026-06-25.
`parseCurrencyConvert` + `renderConvertedBreakdown` (orchestrator.js) + `getCategoryBreakdown`
now returns `rate` (wallet.js). "put all currency in sar" / "convert to sar" / "one currency" /
"breakdown … in sar" / AR بالريال → the breakdown expressed in ONE currency + a Total, using
the household's own `egp_per_sar` (privacy wall intact — rate only, no amount leaves M8). Also
kills the misread where "put all currency in sar" → "How much?" (it ran the add lane). Kill:
`M8_FX_CONVERT_DISABLED=1`. Tests `tests/build153_currency.test.ps1` 23/23 + adjacent 48/48.
🔴 PENDING his live confirm (`tests/BUILD153_LIVE_TEST.md`). Rollback Vercel→`951f4e0`.

**✅ DEPLOYED — Build-152 wallet⇄fleet ARBITER (prod `951f4e0`, READY ~34s, nodejs:12 held):**
merged to main 2026-06-25. New `lib/domain-arbiter.js` decides wallet-vs-fleet ONCE by meaning
(deterministic ownership scoring + a free-LLM tie-breaker fired ONLY on a true contest;
amounts masked, privacy wall intact). Wired into BOTH `orchestrate` + `orchestrateStream`
via shared `resolveDomainRoute()`; replaces the scattered `!looksFleet` guards with one
arbiter; toss-ups ASK ("wallet or fleet?") and a bare "wallet"/"fleet" reply resolves the
original question. Default-safe: neutral/disabled ⇒ byte-for-byte pre-152 behaviour. Kill
switches `M8_DOMAIN_ARBITER_DISABLED=1` (full) / `M8_ARBITER_LLM_DISABLED=1` (model leg).
Council round + decision: `TEAM_ROUND_ROUTING_2026-06-25_RESPONSES.md` (chose: JSON
classifier; wallet⇄fleet scope first; collapsed the shadow-then-flip into ONE reversible
build since M8 has one user). **Tests:** `tests/build152_arbiter.test.ps1` 35/35 + adjacent
mirrors (B151/135/136) 40/40, 0 fail. **🔴 PENDING his live phone confirm**
(`tests/BUILD152_LIVE_TEST.md`). Rollback: kill switch `M8_DOMAIN_ARBITER_DISABLED=1`, or
Vercel→`8b167f9`. Arbiter decisions log (redacted) to `m8_router_misses` lane=`arbiter:*`.

**Prod (origin/main):** `db78817` — Build-150 router miss-logger (DEPLOYED; `m8_router_misses` table created). Session shipped B-135→B-150 (16 builds, 243 passing tests, 0 failures).
**Plan:** see `BUILD_PLAN_150-154.md`. ✅ B-150 done. Muhammad's call (2026-06-25): **SHELVE B-153 email nudges** (he has the Wallet app; low value for him) → **do Career OS next (B-151 memory → B-152 actions)** = serves his #1 goal (job ~July 2026). B-154 cross-domain links = read-only only, last.
**✅ FINAL QA SWEEP DONE (B-135→148):** all 14 Vercel deploys `state: READY` (no syntax errors, nodejs:12 cap held); 158 PS tests pass; every `_wallet.X` call resolves to an export; lane order verified (specific→general, category guard protects the spend lane); privacy invariant statically guarded (formatBriefText has no wallet). NO bugs found. 3 minor polish items only (Arabic replies show English period labels; custom-category+range totals instead of filtering; plain "spend this month" lost the vs-last-month %). Left as-is (low value).
**B-148 is dormant:** set `M8_BRIEF_WALLET_ENABLED=1` on Vercel to turn on the email-only wallet section (confirm brief arrives by email first).

## Evolution sequence he ordered (2026-06-25) — working through it
1. ✅ **B-140 memory hygiene** (DONE) — profile facts never evicted (recall splits profile/operational);
   `isTransientFact` blocks weather/price/score/daily-snapshot/seed at write; 17 stale rows purged (soft).
2. ✅ **B-141 date-ranges + income/net** (DONE) — parseDateRange + getTxnsByRange + PERIOD lane.
3. ⏳ Category insight (next) — "where is the money going", top categories.
4. ⏳ All remaining wallet gaps (comparisons, budgets/bills in chat).
5. ⏳ Surface the note "what for" — APPROVED relaxation: show note to him in app-style reply, NEVER to an LLM.
6. ⏳ Web-search vs memory routing ("who is X" shouldn't web-search a known person).
7. ⏳ Cross-domain links (wallet+tasks+notes+memory).
8. ⏳ Contradiction handling (uses contradiction_flag column).
9. ⏳ Proactive daily brief (fold wallet/bills into the 7am brief).
- NOTE: M8 memory has ~366 current facts, ~215 = Collatz/Lean research history (dormant, beyond recall cap) — left intact.

## ✅ DONE as Build-153 (was: flagged live on phone 2026-06-25) — wallet breakdown currency
Both bugs FIXED + deployed (`33bc213`): (1) the "put all currency in sar" → "How much?" misread
(the convert lane now runs before the add intent brain); (2) the mixed SAR+EGP breakdown now
collapses to ONE currency + Total. NOTE: did NOT need an external FX API — the household already
stores `egp_per_sar` (set in his Wallet app) and `getCategoryBreakdown` already computes each
category's `.base` (SAR); B-153 just renders it + returns the rate. See the B-153 block at top.
**Vercel:** m8-alpha.vercel.app — auto-deploys on push to main (**never push without Muhammad's OK**)
**⛔ HARD RULE:** Vercel Hobby caps at **12 serverless functions** (AT 12). Never add `api/*.js`.

## Wallet UX run — Builds 135 / 136 / 137 (all shipped this session)
- **B-135 wallet recent-expense read** — "what's my last expense?" incl. app-logged ones. `getRecentExpenses()`
  in `lib/wallet.js` (read-only, no `note`), `parseRecentQuery`/`last_expense` routing. 15/15. **Live-confirmed.**
- **B-136 per-member queries** — "Sara's last expense" / "and sara" → that member. `getMembers`/`getMemberSpend`
  + member_id filter; `matchMember`/`isBareMemberRef` (EN+AR aliases). 12/12. Uses existing m8_wallet grants.
- **B-137 family memory** — the "M8 lost about who Sara is" fix. (A) seeded profile fact `spouse_name`
  "Muhammad's wife is Sara" + retired stale test fact `accountant_name`; tiny household roster injected
  (names/roles only). (B) de-greedied the money capability net so a TEACHING sentence reaches the LLM.
  (C) deterministic relationship capture in `lib/memory.js`. 16/16. Kill: `M8_HOUSEHOLD_CONTEXT_DISABLED=1`.
- **B-138 pronouns + dates** — "what was HER last expense" now resolves "her"→Sara (anaphora, then
  gendered household fallback); "her total on 23rd of june" works via `parseExpenseDate`+`getExpensesByDate`
  (yesterday/today/ISO/month-name+day). `resolveMemberCtx` in `lib/orchestrator.js`. 14/14.
- **Two-Saras note:** "Sara" = his WIFE (wallet member). The old "Sara Mansour the accountant" was TEST data,
  now retired. Wallet lane scopes "Sara"→wife by member match. Rollback codes: B135 `bb0bac7`, B137 `5803bcf`, B138 `d3d47f0`.
- 🔴 PENDING his live phone confirm: B-138 (the two failures from tonight) + B-137 no-regression — `tests/BUILD13{7,8}_LIVE_TEST.md`.
- 🟡 KNOWN polish (not done): "who is Sara?" answers correctly (wife) but pads with a useless web search
  for a generic "SARA" acronym — prefer known-person memory over web-search for a name. Candidate B-139.

## What shipped this session — DEPLOYED + verified

**Build-117 (Odysseus probe fix)** — `08a83ff`/`1735905`. Fixed the 3 failing honesty probes
in `lib/discovery.js` (`UPGRADE_PRESSURE_RE` + directive). Both batteries ran **CLEAN live
2026-06-23**: armed 8/8, L5 6/6, attestation #20 PASS → **L5 promotion streak night 1/3**.
B117 44/44 + regressions green.

**Build-118 (live web-search waterfall)** — `8016c25`. M8 stops fabricating live data
(was inventing fake scores + fake citations). 3 files: `lib/tools/serperSearch.js` (NEW,
Serper/Google wrapper) + `lib/search.js` (Serper→Tavily waterfall, ~3500/mo free) +
`lib/intentClassifier.js` (bare "score"/"who won"/Arabic now search). B118 32/32 + routing
regressions green. **Live-verified working on his phone.** Rollback = Vercel→`08a83ff` or unset `SERPER_API_KEY`.

## 🔴 Only pending item: L5 promotion streak (automatic)

The Odysseus battery is now CLEAN. The nightly cron (~1am) counts clean nights automatically.
**Night 1/3 done (attestation #20).** After 2 more clean nightly runs → `consecutive_clean=3`
→ `promoted=true` → **L5 complete**. Nothing for Muhammad to do — just watch `m8_loop_runs`.
(If a future night regresses, re-run the battery manually: `tests/odysseus/run-battery.ps1
-File battery-m3-armed.json -SessionPrefix live_test` + `-File battery-l5.json -AttestTo <date> -Secret $env:CRON_SECRET`.)

## L5 promotion gate — what's blocking

| Gate condition | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| `run_status=ok` | ✅ nightly cron runs |
| `m3_gate_pass=true` | ✅ Wilson-Newcombe gate passes |
| `survivors_persisted >= 1` | ✅ survivors persist |
| `odysseus_pass=true` | 🔴 **FAILING** — battery has 3 failing probes (fixed in B117, pending deploy) |
| `consecutive_clean >= 3` | 🔴 0 — blocked by above |

**After B117 deploys, re-run the battery** (`tests/odysseus/battery-m3-armed.json` + `tests/odysseus/battery-l5.json`) via the `run-odysseus-battery.ps1` script (or equivalent). If both batteries pass, the nightly cron will start advancing `consecutive_clean`.

---

## What to do next (prioritized)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 🔴 1 | Merge `fix/odysseus-probe-fix` → main → push (auto-deploys) |
| 🔴 2 | Run Odysseus battery — verify all probes pass live |
| 🟢 3 | Watch the next nightly cron row in `m8_loop_runs` for `odysseus_pass=true`, `consecutive_clean=1` |
| ⚪ 4 | Once `consecutive_clean >= 3`: L5 gate passes → begin L6 planning |

## Key constraints (never forget)

- **Fable 5 BLOCKED** (US gov) — use Opus for autonomous high-effort sessions
- **Vercel 12-function cap** — NEVER add `api/*.js`; fold new endpoints into `api/ops.js` via `?fn=`
- **Never git add -A** — add files by name only
- **PS 5.1 host** — no Node; all tests are PS mirrors; use `[IO.File]::ReadAllText` for UTF-8
- **Use PowerShell `.Replace()`** for `m8_mind_2026.html` edits (em-dash U+2014 breaks Edit tool)
- **Financial text NEVER enters LLM** — privacy wall in place (`MONEY_SENTINEL` strip)
- **Pushing main auto-deploys prod** — always await explicit "merge/deploy" OK

## Canonical docs (update on every ship)

- `NORTH_STAR.md` — maturity ladder + vision (update % and Session/Build footer)
- `m8_mind_2026.html` — the "M8 Mind" diagram (update status cells and footer comment only)
