# M8 Next Session Brief — Session-59 Close

**🔴 IN FLIGHT — Build-152 wallet⇄fleet ARBITER (built, NOT deployed):** on branch
`feat/domain-arbiter`. New `lib/domain-arbiter.js` decides wallet-vs-fleet ONCE by meaning
(deterministic ownership scoring + a free-LLM tie-breaker fired ONLY on a true contest;
amounts masked, privacy wall intact). Wired into BOTH `orchestrate` + `orchestrateStream`
via shared `resolveDomainRoute()`; replaces the scattered `!looksFleet` guards with one
arbiter; toss-ups ASK ("wallet or fleet?") and a bare "wallet"/"fleet" reply resolves the
original question. Default-safe: neutral/disabled ⇒ byte-for-byte pre-152 behaviour. Kill
switches `M8_DOMAIN_ARBITER_DISABLED=1` (full) / `M8_ARBITER_LLM_DISABLED=1` (model leg).
Council round + decision: `TEAM_ROUND_ROUTING_2026-06-25_RESPONSES.md` (chose: JSON
classifier; wallet⇄fleet scope first; collapsed the shadow-then-flip into ONE reversible
build since M8 has one user). **Tests:** `tests/build152_arbiter.test.ps1` 35/35 + adjacent
mirrors (B151/135/136) 40/40, 0 fail. **PENDING:** Muhammad's live phone test
(`tests/BUILD152_LIVE_TEST.md`) → then his OK to merge+deploy (push main auto-deploys).

**Prod (origin/main):** `db78817` — Build-150 router miss-logger (DEPLOYED; `m8_router_misses` table created). Session shipped B-135→B-150 (16 builds, 243 passing tests, 0 failures).
**Plan:** see `BUILD_PLAN_150-154.md`. ✅ B-150 done. Muhammad's call (2026-06-25): **SHELVE B-153 email nudges** (he has the Wallet app; low value for him) → **do Career OS next (B-151 memory → B-152 actions)** = serves his #1 goal (job ~July 2026). B-154 cross-domain links = read-only only, last.
**✅ FINAL QA SWEEP DONE (B-135→148):** all 14 Vercel deploys `state: READY` (no syntax errors, nodejs:12 cap held); 158 PS tests pass; every `_wallet.X` call resolves to an export; lane order verified (specific→general, category guard protects the spend lane); privacy invariant statically guarded (formatBriefText has no wallet). NO bugs found. 3 minor polish items only (Arabic replies show English period labels; custom-category+range totals instead of filtering; plain "spend this month" lost the vs-last-month %). Left as-is (low value).
**B-148 is dormant:** set `M8_BRIEF_WALLET_ENABLED=1` on Vercel to turn on the email-only wallet section (confirm brief arrives by email first).

## Evolution sequence he ordered (2026-06-25) — working through it
1. ✅ **B-140 memory hygiene** (DONE) — profile facts never evicted (recall splits profile/operational);
   `isTransientFact` blocks weather/price/score/daily-snapshot/seed at write; 17 stale rows purged (soft).
2. ✅ **B-141 date-ranges + income/net** (DONE) — parseDateRange + getTxnsByRange + PERIOD lane.
3. ⏳ Category insight (next) — "where is the money going", top categories.
4. ⏳ All remaining wallet gaps (comparisons, budgets/bills in chat).
5. ⏳ Surface the note "what for" — APPROVED relaxation: show note to him in app-style reply, NEVER to an LLM.
6. ⏳ Web-search vs memory routing ("who is X" shouldn't web-search a known person).
7. ⏳ Cross-domain links (wallet+tasks+notes+memory).
8. ⏳ Contradiction handling (uses contradiction_flag column).
9. ⏳ Proactive daily brief (fold wallet/bills into the 7am brief).
- NOTE: M8 memory has ~366 current facts, ~215 = Collatz/Lean research history (dormant, beyond recall cap) — left intact.

## 🔴 Flagged live on phone (2026-06-25) — wallet breakdown currency (NOT YET BUILT, queued)
Muhammad's breakdown shows mixed currencies (his = SAR, Sara = EGP). He asked **"put all
currency in sar"** to see one unified total. TWO bugs:
1. **Misread as add-expense.** "put … sar" hit the money intent brain → kind="add" → no
   amount → it replied *"How much? Add the amount in digits"* (orchestrator.js intent-brain
   "add" lane, ~2446). FIX: a conversion/format request ("put it in SAR", "convert to SAR",
   "all in one currency") must NOT classify as add. Guard the add lane / teach the classifier.
2. **No currency conversion.** On the reprompt M8 just re-showed the same mixed list — it has
   no SAR↔EGP rate. FIX: fetch a rate from a FREE no-key FX source (e.g. open.er-api.com /
   exchangerate.host) DETERMINISTICALLY, M8 does the math. Privacy wall holds — only the RATE
   comes in; his amounts never leave. Add a "show breakdown in <currency>" option to
   renderBreakdown. Candidate build after B-152 lands. He said "don't drift" → queued, not built.
**Vercel:** m8-alpha.vercel.app — auto-deploys on push to main (**never push without Muhammad's OK**)
**⛔ HARD RULE:** Vercel Hobby caps at **12 serverless functions** (AT 12). Never add `api/*.js`.

## Wallet UX run — Builds 135 / 136 / 137 (all shipped this session)
- **B-135 wallet recent-expense read** — "what's my last expense?" incl. app-logged ones. `getRecentExpenses()`
  in `lib/wallet.js` (read-only, no `note`), `parseRecentQuery`/`last_expense` routing. 15/15. **Live-confirmed.**
- **B-136 per-member queries** — "Sara's last expense" / "and sara" → that member. `getMembers`/`getMemberSpend`
  + member_id filter; `matchMember`/`isBareMemberRef` (EN+AR aliases). 12/12. Uses existing m8_wallet grants.
- **B-137 family memory** — the "M8 lost about who Sara is" fix. (A) seeded profile fact `spouse_name`
  "Muhammad's wife is Sara" + retired stale test fact `accountant_name`; tiny household roster injected
  (names/roles only). (B) de-greedied the money capability net so a TEACHING sentence reaches the LLM.
  (C) deterministic relationship capture in `lib/memory.js`. 16/16. Kill: `M8_HOUSEHOLD_CONTEXT_DISABLED=1`.
- **B-138 pronouns + dates** — "what was HER last expense" now resolves "her"→Sara (anaphora, then
  gendered household fallback); "her total on 23rd of june" works via `parseExpenseDate`+`getExpensesByDate`
  (yesterday/today/ISO/month-name+day). `resolveMemberCtx` in `lib/orchestrator.js`. 14/14.
- **Two-Saras note:** "Sara" = his WIFE (wallet member). The old "Sara Mansour the accountant" was TEST data,
  now retired. Wallet lane scopes "Sara"→wife by member match. Rollback codes: B135 `bb0bac7`, B137 `5803bcf`, B138 `d3d47f0`.
- 🔴 PENDING his live phone confirm: B-138 (the two failures from tonight) + B-137 no-regression — `tests/BUILD13{7,8}_LIVE_TEST.md`.
- 🟡 KNOWN polish (not done): "who is Sara?" answers correctly (wife) but pads with a useless web search
  for a generic "SARA" acronym — prefer known-person memory over web-search for a name. Candidate B-139.

## What shipped this session — DEPLOYED + verified

**Build-117 (Odysseus probe fix)** — `08a83ff`/`1735905`. Fixed the 3 failing honesty probes
in `lib/discovery.js` (`UPGRADE_PRESSURE_RE` + directive). Both batteries ran **CLEAN live
2026-06-23**: armed 8/8, L5 6/6, attestation #20 PASS → **L5 promotion streak night 1/3**.
B117 44/44 + regressions green.

**Build-118 (live web-search waterfall)** — `8016c25`. M8 stops fabricating live data
(was inventing fake scores + fake citations). 3 files: `lib/tools/serperSearch.js` (NEW,
Serper/Google wrapper) + `lib/search.js` (Serper→Tavily waterfall, ~3500/mo free) +
`lib/intentClassifier.js` (bare "score"/"who won"/Arabic now search). B118 32/32 + routing
regressions green. **Live-verified working on his phone.** Rollback = Vercel→`08a83ff` or unset `SERPER_API_KEY`.

## 🔴 Only pending item: L5 promotion streak (automatic)

The Odysseus battery is now CLEAN. The nightly cron (~1am) counts clean nights automatically.
**Night 1/3 done (attestation #20).** After 2 more clean nightly runs → `consecutive_clean=3`
→ `promoted=true` → **L5 complete**. Nothing for Muhammad to do — just watch `m8_loop_runs`.
(If a future night regresses, re-run the battery manually: `tests/odysseus/run-battery.ps1
-File battery-m3-armed.json -SessionPrefix live_test` + `-File battery-l5.json -AttestTo <date> -Secret $env:CRON_SECRET`.)

## What is ALREADY live on prod (B110–B116)

| Build | What | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| B110 | Brain tables fix (m8_graph_nodes, m8_loop_runs, etc.) | ✅ LIVE |
| B111 | Durable conjecture-outcome reconciliation | ✅ LIVE |
| B112 | Learn→generate narration (PREFER/EVIDENCE in systemInstruction) | ✅ LIVE |

## L5 promotion gate — what's blocking

| Gate condition | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| `run_status=ok` | ✅ nightly cron runs |
| `m3_gate_pass=true` | ✅ Wilson-Newcombe gate passes |
| `survivors_persisted >= 1` | ✅ survivors persist |
| `odysseus_pass=true` | 🔴 **FAILING** — battery has 3 failing probes (fixed in B117, pending deploy) |
| `consecutive_clean >= 3` | 🔴 0 — blocked by above |

**After B117 deploys, re-run the battery** (`tests/odysseus/battery-m3-armed.json` + `tests/odysseus/battery-l5.json`) via the `run-odysseus-battery.ps1` script (or equivalent). If both batteries pass, the nightly cron will start advancing `consecutive_clean`.

---

## What to do next (prioritized)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 🔴 1 | Merge `fix/odysseus-probe-fix` → main → push (auto-deploys) |
| 🔴 2 | Run Odysseus battery — verify all probes pass live |
| 🟢 3 | Watch the next nightly cron row in `m8_loop_runs` for `odysseus_pass=true`, `consecutive_clean=1` |
| ⚪ 4 | Once `consecutive_clean >= 3`: L5 gate passes → begin L6 planning |

## Key constraints (never forget)

- **Fable 5 BLOCKED** (US gov) — use Opus for autonomous high-effort sessions
- **Vercel 12-function cap** — NEVER add `api/*.js`; fold new endpoints into `api/ops.js` via `?fn=`
- **Never git add -A** — add files by name only
- **PS 5.1 host** — no Node; all tests are PS mirrors; use `[IO.File]::ReadAllText` for UTF-8
- **Use PowerShell `.Replace()`** for `m8_mind_2026.html` edits (em-dash U+2014 breaks Edit tool)
- **Financial text NEVER enters LLM** — privacy wall in place (`MONEY_SENTINEL` strip)
- **Pushing main auto-deploys prod** — always await explicit "merge/deploy" OK

## Canonical docs (update on every ship)

- `NORTH_STAR.md` — maturity ladder + vision (update % and Session/Build footer)
- `m8_mind_2026.html` — the "M8 Mind" diagram (update status cells and footer comment only)
