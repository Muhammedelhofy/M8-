## ★ SESSION-42 HANDOFF (read first) — 2026-06-17

**What shipped this session:**
- **buildState.js syntax fix** (`26f68a0`) — PS replace during Session-41 split `commitFamily` string, leaving a dangling string literal on line 16 that crashed all `/api/chat` requests with 500. Fixed by removing the stray line.
- **narrateWarmPending timing fix** (`3f3361b`) — corrected "60 seconds" → "up to 10 minutes from a cold start" (Cloud Run takes ~9.5 min).
- **Build-51 LIVE-VERIFIED** (Session-42, 2026-06-17) — two-turn warm flow confirmed end-to-end:
  - "propose a decomposition for: the product of two odd integers is odd" → `[PROPOSED PLAN]` rendered, wake-up ping fired (04:20).
  - "approve decomposition #3" → cold checker → warm-pending message returned.
  - "verify now" (10 min later, 04:41) → checker warm → Lean ran.
  - **Results: L1 REJECTED** (Lean error: "No goals to be solved" — tactic-ordering issue in the generated proof, not a Build-51 bug). **L2 VERIFIED ✓**. L3 scaffolded (sorry). 1/2 leaves verified. Gate qualifying leaf (induction + ≥2 Mathlib namespaces): no. Target stays OPEN CONJECTURE. Honesty held.

**Previous session (Session-41) recap:**
- **S4U elevation** — `M8-L5-Nightly-Attest` task now `LogonType=S4U`, fires at 05:00 even when logged off.
- **Build-51 — Warm-Checker Strategy for Interactive M4** (`55f5fa2`, SHIPPED + OFFLINE-VERIFIED 46/46 + LIVE-VERIFIED). `warmLeanChecker`, propose wake-ping, approve warm-gate, VERIFY_NOW_RE flow. No migration. No new endpoint.

### ▶ NEXT MOVES (in order)
1. ✅ **Build-51 live-verified** (Session-42).
2. **Rate task scores** in the Command Center ledger (`strategic_value` + `urgency`) — all at neutral defaults 3/3. Ask M8 "what's the priority?" to see current ranking, then update values in Supabase `m8_cc_tasks` table.
3. **L5 gate watch** — S4U live, Build-49 graders fixed. Check `m8_loop_runs` / `m8_odysseus_runs` over coming nights.
4. **Engine depth**: M4→proposer feedback loop (surface Lean error, redraft leaf — L1's "No goals to be solved" is a natural first target) OR multi-level DAG decompositions.

### Kickoff prompt to paste next session
> Continue M8 (Session-43). Read `M8/NEXT_SESSION_BRIEF.md` (Session-42 handoff) first.
> Build-51 (warm-checker for M4) SHIPPED + LIVE-VERIFIED — two-turn flow confirmed, 1/2 leaves verified (L2 ✓, L1 Lean error "No goals to be solved").
> Priorities: (1) rate CC ledger task scores (`strategic_value`+`urgency` in Supabase `m8_cc_tasks` — all at default 3); (2) engine depth — M4→proposer feedback loop OR multi-level DAGs. Standing rules: free Gemini stack; live runs need my OK; M8 is its own repo (`Muhammedelhofy/M8-`); edit `buildState.js commitFamily` only via unique-anchor replace; PS .ps1 files must be pure ASCII.

## ★ SESSION-40 HANDOFF (read first) — 2026-06-17

**What shipped this session (all pushed to `github.com/Muhammedelhofy/M8-` main):**
- **Build-50 — Command Center v1** (`9f66e77`, SHIPPED). Decision 2026-0617-CC. All 7 steps complete:
  - `lib/command-center.js` — deterministic Priority Engine (value-weighted dependency-blockage,
    priority bands, cycle+max-depth-8 guards, blocked-filter, degraded-mode snapshot, proactive
    inline-logging offer, staleness alarm). PRIORITY_RE bug found+fixed by the test suite.
  - `lib/orchestrator.js` — `detectPriorityQuery` hard-route wired (after engine run-detectors,
    no new Vercel endpoint, stream delegates); proactive logging offer wired at final return.
  - `migrations/m8_command_center.sql` + `migrations/m8_cc_seed.sql` — applied to Supabase
    (`ltqpoupferwituusxwal`): 4 projects, 13 tasks (real states/deps/gate flags), decision log.
  - `data/command_center_snapshot.json` — degraded-mode fallback, written on every live load.
  - `m8_command_center.html` — double-click view, renders snapshot offline (zero anon-key,
    live-verified: correct bands, blocked deps, value-weighted blockage ordering).
  - `tests/command-center-verify.ps1` — 36/36 offline (engine math + routing).
  - `lib/buildState.js` — bumped to Build-50.

**Live test (do this after Vercel deploy confirms):**
1. Open `https://m8-alpha.vercel.app/api/health` — confirm `"build":"Build-50"`.
2. In M8 chat type: `"what's the priority?"` — should return the narrated bands packet
   (Critical/Important/Active/Queued bands + blocked list + honesty footer).
3. Type: `"open the command center"` — same route.
4. Type: `"what should we work on next?"` — same route (pronoun branch).
5. Open `M8/m8_command_center.html` in a browser served from the repo root — should render
   all 4 projects, priority bands, blocked tasks, health strip.

**OPS: score inputs are all at neutral defaults (3/3/3/3/3)** — `strategic_value` is your
human judgment (spec D1). After the live test, rate the tasks via M8 chat or direct Supabase
edits to get a meaningful first real ranking. M8 will offer to help narrate the scores.

### ▶ NEXT MOVES (in order)

1. **Live-verify Build-50** (above test script) — confirm the chat route works end-to-end.
2. **Rate the task scores** — especially `strategic_value` (your judgment: low=1/med=3/high=5)
   and `urgency` on the current active tasks. The priority ranking becomes meaningful once these
   are set vs the neutral defaults.
3. **L5 gate watch** — Build-49 should start banking clean nights. Check `m8_loop_runs` /
   `m8_odysseus_runs` over the next nights. Risk: per-seed m3_gate miss or logged-off 05:00.
4. **S4U elevation** — so the nightly runs fire even when logged off. One elevated-PowerShell
   command; ask M8 for click-by-click when ready.
5. **Engine depth (next big build)** — warm-checker strategy for interactive M4 (unblocks the
   first live Lean-verified leaf on a real non-degenerate decomposition).

### Kickoff prompt to paste next session
> Continue M8 (Session-41). Read `M8/NEXT_SESSION_BRIEF.md` (Session-40 handoff) first.
> Build-50 (Command Center v1) is SHIPPED — all 7 steps done, pushed `9f66e77`.
> Start with the live-verify test script above (confirm `/api/health` shows Build-50, then
> test the priority chat route). After that: rate the task scores (strategic_value + urgency)
> so the first real ranking is meaningful, then move to the engine depth build (warm-checker
> strategy for interactive M4). Standing rules: free Gemini stack; live runs need my OK;
> M8 is its own repo (`Muhammedelhofy/M8-`); edit `buildState.js commitFamily` only via a
> unique-anchor replace; PS .ps1 files must be pure ASCII.

## ★ SESSION-39 HANDOFF (read first) — 2026-06-17

**What shipped this session (all pushed to `github.com/Muhammedelhofy/M8-` main):**
- **Build-47** smarter conjecture-gen (`4aa27b2`, LIVE) — kernel engine proposes K=6 candidates + a triviality floor.
- **Build-48 + Build-49** — **THE FIX for the stuck 0/3 L5 gate.** Root cause found in live Supabase data: the
  fabrication-class (`absent`) Odysseus checks scored *honest denials* as fabrications (a denial that quotes a
  forbidden phrase — "can't confirm WHETHER this is a known result", "it DOESN'T autonomously prove", "does NOT
  mean the conjecture is proven"). `absent`=hard-fail that best-of-N never re-runs, so a different 1-3 probes
  flaked each night → 0/3 with M8 fully honest. Fixed with bounded negation/hedge lookbehinds (`NG`) on 7 probes
  across the 2 gating batteries. **Graders run LOCALLY in the Windows nightly → already live for the 05:00 run.**
  Offline `tests/grader-fix-verify.ps1` **22/22** incl. a GOLD check vs tonight's REAL fail text (both probes would
  now pass). Trajectory: 06-16 = 3 fails → 06-17 = 12/14, 2 fails → Build-49 closes those 2.
- **HEADLINE:** the autonomous loop **already machine-verified its first Lean leaf on 06-16** (`m8_loop_runs`
  m4_leaves_verified 1/1) — the "verified leaf still pending" belief was stale.
- **Diagrams:** the **M8 Mind** (`m8_mind_2026.html`) was updated in place — new Executive/Command-Center region,
  corrected gate/leaf status, priorities, Build-49 footer. (A separate `m8_plan_2026.html` board exists but is
  redundant — Muhammad may want it deleted.)

**OPS LESSON (don't forget):** the battery runner already saves every probe **reply + failing-check** to
`tests/odysseus/results/<runId>.json` LOCALLY — read that to diagnose grader fails offline at zero Gemini cost;
only the Supabase attestation omits them (followup: persist fails+replies to the attestation too).

**The Council pattern (adopted):** for MAJOR decisions — Propose → the other models *attack* (not "agree?") →
synthesize → LOCK → build. Roles: Claude=consistency/spec/PM · GPT=100×/systems · Grok=resilience/SPOF ·
Gemini=cloud/cost · Manus=prior-art/decomposition. Decisions get logged (the Command Center's decision-log).

### ▶ NEXT MOVE = finish Command Center v1 (build #1, spec LOCKED)
Spec: [`COMMAND_CENTER_SPEC.md`](COMMAND_CENTER_SPEC.md) (locked from the GPT/Gemini/Grok/Manus red-team; v0 +
critiques in git history). **Engine WIP already committed** (`27dd4e2`, INERT — not wired, migration not applied):
- `migrations/m8_command_center.sql` — `m8_cc_projects/tasks/decisions` (STAGED, apply in Supabase with OK).
- `lib/command-center.js` — pure deterministic engine (value-weighted dependency-blockage per GPT, priority
  bands, cycle + max-depth-8 guards, blocked filter, score), narration, degraded-mode snapshot, fail-safe DB I/O,
  tight `detectPriorityQuery`. **UNVERIFIED (no local Node) and not imported.**

**Remaining v1 steps (in order):**
1. Write + run `tests/command-center-verify.ps1` (PS mirror, ASCII, inline): value-weighted blockage incl. the
   GPT case (A unblocks 5 trivial vs G unblocks 1 high-value Memory build → **G must rank higher**, and raw COUNT
   would have wrongly favored A); band thresholds; cycle guard rejects **A→B→C→A** (Manus 3.3); max-depth-8;
   blocked-filter (unmet deps). Fix any engine bug it surfaces.
2. Apply `m8_command_center.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor — **needs Muhammad's explicit OK** (prod write).
3. Wire ONE chat hard-route in `lib/orchestrator.js`: `detectPriorityQuery` → `getPrioritiesContext()` narrated
   (NO new Vercel endpoint — Hobby caps at 12). Place it among the deterministic hard-routes.
4. Proactive inline-logging offer (M8 offers to log a task/decision during normal work) + the >5-day staleness alarm.
5. Seed the ledger from the agreed roadmap (gate-fix done, Command Center building, depth, Track-A, hygiene) +
   log this Council as `m8_cc_decisions` row (Decision `2026-0617-CC`).
6. Generate `data/command_center_snapshot.json` (degraded-mode fallback) + a thin `m8_command_center.html` that
   renders the snapshot (zero functions, no anon-key exposure) + the minimal health strip.
7. Bump `buildState.js` to **Build-50** on ship (live[] newest-first + commitFamily tail).
**Honesty invariants (spec §4):** code computes the priority, M8 narrates WHY, human approves; M8 never re-ranks
or changes a state; strategic_value is narrated AS a human judgment.

### Also pending
- **Gate watch:** read `m8_loop_runs` / `m8_odysseus_runs` over the next nights — Build-49 should start banking
  clean nights (1/3 → …). Risks: a per-seed m3_gate miss (stochastic) or a logged-off 05:00 (Interactive logon).
- **S4U elevation** (so the nightly runs logged-off) — one elevated-PowerShell command; give Muhammad click-by-click.
- Small followup: persist probe fails+replies into the Supabase attestation (Round-5 #5 telemetry).

### Kickoff prompt to paste next session

## ★ SESSION-38 CURRENT STATE — read this first (the cross-session source of truth)

**The problem-solving-engine roadmap is COMPLETE and LIVE: Build-43 D → B → A → C all shipped + live-verified.**
- **D** (`cfff4c1`) — fringe idea → testable claim (kernel → computable conjecture → falsifier → "observed through N").
- **B** (`5ce54ec`) — test the user's LITERAL claim first (counterexample), then offer the nearest-TRUE pattern.
- **A** (`10edb8d`) — **M8 plans the attack**: drafts an anti-degeneracy-gated lemma-DAG for a target, human approves `#N`, the existing M4/Lean lane verifies the leaves (k/m; target stays an OPEN CONJECTURE). `lib/decomp-proposer.js`; migration `m8_decomp_proposals.sql` applied.
- **C** (`7bb79e9`) — **2nd problem domain = reverse-and-add / Lychrel "196"** (`lib/lychrel-probes.js`, BigInt). A structural twin of the Collatz M1 census; proves the engine generalizes. LIVE: found exactly the 13 known Lychrel candidates < 1000 (OEIS A023108), conjecture "every n≤1000 within K" falsified at 196, all framed OPEN.

**LOCKED DECISION — depth over breadth ([`m8-depth-over-breadth`] memory):** with C done, the engine has TWO domains so "it generalizes" is proven. **STOP adding problem domains.** Future engine work goes into DEPTH (smarter conjectures, deeper decompositions, discharging more leaves), NOT more domains. Revisit breadth only on an explicit ask.

**IN-FLIGHT (separate session/account):** a "make the M8 diagram better → mind/brain map + Tasks/Projects/Evolution" effort is being done in a DIFFERENT Claude session. Its agreed vision is captured in [`M8/MIND_DIAGRAM_BRIEF.md`](MIND_DIAGRAM_BRIEF.md). That session must `git pull` first (this repo is ahead at `54162e4`) and push its work to the `M8-` repo so it isn't lost. The engine work (this brief) and the diagram work (that brief) are independent — no code overlap.

**Honesty spine (unchanged law):** `lean_verified` is the ONLY path to `proven`; a counterexample the ONLY path to `refuted`; ingestion/extraction reach neither; narration ≤ evidence; code computes truth, the LLM narrates. Free Gemini/Tavily stack. Live runs cost Gemini quota + need Muhammad's OK.

### ▶ THE PLAN FROM HERE (sequenced — don't lose progress)
1. **ANTI-LOSS GATE (must pass before the diagram is "done"):** the new mind-diagram (`m8_mind_2026.html`)
   is NOT finished until it has been verified ITEM-BY-ITEM against [`M8_INVENTORY.md`](M8_INVENTORY.md)'s
   checklist — the diagram session must output a "PLACED / OMITTED (why)" table covering every checklist
   line, and Muhammad reviews it. The OLD diagram (`m8_full_architecture_2026.html`) STAYS in place until
   the new one passes this gate. (This is the safeguard against losing things like the unforbidden-knowledge
   axis, which the old diagram lost once.)
2. **Finalize the mind-diagram** (separate session, per `MIND_DIAGRAM_BRIEF.md`) → commit `m8_mind_2026.html`.
3. **Resume engine DEPTH** (the locked next direction — NOT more domains).
   ✅ **Build-44 (Depth-1) SHIPPED + LIVE-DEMOED (`83f5799`)** — biased the Option-A proposer toward
   Lean-FORMALIZABLE leaves (elementary base facts; hard reasoning → parents). Live: the anti-degeneracy
   gate fired on "sum of first n odds = n²" (model restated the target as a lemma → rejected), then
   "the product of two odd integers is odd" → a clean non-degenerate plan with 2 elementary leaves →
   approve → A→M4 pipeline ran end-to-end, but the Lean checker was COLD so leaves returned `lean_pending`
   (verified 0/2, target OPEN — honest). **⏳ The green verified-leaf is pending a WARM checker** (Cloud
   Run ~9.5 min cold start) — the nightly L5 warm re-check (`recheckScaffold`) re-submits the stored leaf
   code and should verify it; OR warm `/health` then re-run the scaffold. **FINDING:** 3 interactive warm attempts (incl. a 9.5-min
   wait) all returned `lean_pending` — the checker scales to zero + 503s on a cold request, and one
   `/api/chat` Lean check only holds ~55s, so **interactive M4 can't reliably warm it (infra, not code).**
   **NEXT depth iterations** (pick one, spec-first):
   - ⭐ **(recommended) WARM-CHECKER STRATEGY for interactive M4** — pre-warm on the propose/scaffold step
     (L5-style: `/health` ping then hold/retry until ready) so the checker is hot by the time leaves
     submit. This directly unblocks the live verified leaf (the only thing standing between us and it).
   - **Make M4 discharge a REAL (non-degenerate) decomposition** — the logged §0.4 caveat was that the
     verified DAG was degenerate (L1 ≈ target). Now that Option A drafts non-degenerate plans, wire a
     genuine multi-leaf target through Option A → approve → M4 and get >0 real leaves Lean-verified.
   - **Smarter conjecture generation** (Option B's "richer guesses" — LLM proposes, deterministic falsifier
     polices) to raise candidate quality.
   - **Deeper decompositions** (Option A drafting multi-level DAGs, not just one layer).

---

## ✅ RESOLVED THIS SESSION: live image vision (Build-34) is FIXED

**Root cause (not the SDK/model/field-shape the Session-33 brief suspected):** the clarification +
doc **early-returns** in `orchestrate()` run ~200 lines *before* `imgTurn` was computed. On an image
turn the tool-decision (`decideAction`), specificity (`checkSpecificity`), or `INTENT.DOC` gate saw
only the message TEXT ("read this image"), not the attached `inlineData` part, and early-RETURNED a
"what image?" clarification **before** `buildUserParts` ever added the image. That also explains the
missing `request_traces` on failing calls (early return precedes the trace insert) and the
intermittency (the one phrasing that slipped the gates went full-pipeline and read the image fine).

**Fix (`c5023d0`):** hoist `const imgTurn = hasImageAttachments(attachments)` to the top of
`orchestrate()` and gate every pre-vision early-return on `!imgTurn` (DOC gate, INTENT.NONE
tool-clarify, both specificity gates incl. the web-search slot). `/api/chat` + `/api/chat-stream`
both covered (stream delegates image turns to buffered orchestrate). VISIONDBG stripped (`032ce9e`).

**Live-verified on `m8-alpha.vercel.app`:** PNG read 4/4, JPEG read clean, quota → honest
`IMAGE_FALLBACK` (not "what image?"). Traces now record image turns (`intent=NONE, search=False,
prov=gemini, ok=True`). **Build-37 now live-verified** (S1 degenerate honest "blank", S2 reads, S4
no downstream confab). Offline: image-attachment 25/25, vision-blind 20/20, attachment 21/21,
fleet-routing 19/19.

**Lesson for next time:** when a new feature adds a turn-type gate (like `imgTurn`), evaluate it
BEFORE every pre-existing early-return that can swallow the turn — and trust the *trace absence* over
a "payload looks correct" round-trip when diagnosing a dropped-modality bug.

## Where we are (all shipped + pushed)

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `c5023d0`/`032ce9e`/`7ca2484` | **Build-34 LIVE VISION FIX (Session-34).** Hoisted `imgTurn` + gated the clarify/doc early-returns on `!imgTurn`; VISIONDBG stripped; plan updated. Live-verified (see top). |
| `aa18326` | **Build-37 — Silent Vision-Miss Guard.** Success-path guard: an image turn whose reply denies sight ("I can't see images") → honest `IMAGE_BLIND_RESPONSE`, not a blind reply a later turn confabulates from. `VISION_BLIND_RE` + `SAW_IMAGE_RE` veto; precision-guarded so the legit "too blurry to read" hedge survives; success-path only. **Offline `vision-blind-verify.ps1` 20/20; now LIVE-VERIFIED (Session-34).** |
| `c51efb2`/`f1f627a`/`25a3e62` | **Team Round 5** brief + synthesis (all 5 crew). Headline: best-of-N integrity holds *by construction*; real risk = selection integrity. Per-probe audit: **14/14 carry their anti-fab signal in an `absent` check.** Decisions: Build-37 = vision guard (done); Build-38 = provenance-at-ingestion; epistemic axis deferred ("trust before taxonomy"). |
| `12fbd57`/`2342cc9` | **Build-36 — best-of-N L5 gate relaxation.** Framing-only flakes re-run (default N=3); fabrication-class (`absent`/`refusal`/`anyOf`) = instant hard block, never re-run. `loop-verify.ps1` 52/52; combined live dry-run 14/14 → ATTEST PASS. |

Also: `M8-L5-Nightly-Attest` task re-registered (StartWhenAvailable, battery-resilient, 1h limit; `CRON_SECRET` confirmed User-level; still Interactive logon — S4U needs an elevated shell).

---

## ✅ SESSION-35 (2026-06-15, Opus): Build-39 shipped + live-verified; CRON_SECRET closed

- **Build-39 — read-path trust tiers** (`85f7752`, pushed, LIVE on deploy `6215582`). `renderGraphPacket`
  groups recall nodes into VERIFIED/EMPIRICAL/HEURISTIC/UNVERIFIED/REFUTED tiers (most-trusted first,
  cosine order within tier), flags `confidence<0.5` non-proven nodes "low confidence", appends a TRUST
  TIERS directive. Makes Build-38's `verification_state`/`confidence` ACT on the read path. No migration.
  `tests/trust-tier-verify.ps1` 12/12; live query narrated under verbatim Empirical/Unverified headers,
  flagged the [SPECULATIVE] claim, and refused to invent a VERIFIED node when none was in top-k.
- **CRON_SECRET in Vercel prod — CONFIRMED enforced** (unauth `/api/graph-relabel` → 401). Backlog
  item CLOSED — no action was needed.
- **`/api/health` now reports `deploy.sha`/`ref`/`env`** (`6215582`) — deterministic deploy-confirm so a
  live test can verify WHICH commit is serving (closes the push→serve-lag gap the live-test docs flag).
- **Build-40 — self-status search-routing guard** (`073150a`, pushed, LIVE on its own deploy).
  "what's your most recent build?" no longer web-searches Windows updates: shared `SELF_STATUS_RE`/
  `isSelfStatus` in `lib/intentClassifier.js`, `classifyIntent`→NONE for self-status, orchestrator ORs
  it into `buildQuery` at both sites. Fixed the stale `classifier-test.js` import too.
  `tests/intent-routing-verify.ps1` 26/26; live Q1 (self-status→build state, no search) + Q2
  ("latest keeta news"→still searched) both PASS.
- **NEXT in order:** #3 **full epistemic axis** (now unblocked — "trust before taxonomy" satisfied by
  Build-38/39). Then backlog: #12 search UNDER-routing (needs an example corpus first; build-state feed
  also lags — names Build-37 as "most recent"), #11 open-conjecture literature seed reads `empirical`
  (Build-38 classification refinement). See HONESTY_TRACK_PLAN backlog for the full list.

## (historical) NEXT BUILD → Build-38 (vision now resolved)
**Provenance + `trust_state` at ingestion** (crew-unanimous Q2, "trust before taxonomy"). Extend Build-30
provenance beyond `m8_conversations` to **graph nodes + the Build-27 intake path**: every node carries
`source · timestamp · evidence_kind (hypothesis/experiment/result/failed_path) · confidence ·
verification_state` *before* graph expansion scales. Enabler for both the epistemic axis and L6.
*Files: intake / `lib/memory-graph.js`.* Then: broaden search routing (`lib/intentClassifier.js`);
the deferred full epistemic axis. Round-5 honesty follow-ups (per-attempt telemetry, selector-stress
probes, `GRAPH_EVIDENCE_CAP` verification, uncertainty-calibration probes) — see HONESTY_TRACK_PLAN backlog.

---

## Standing notes
- Live runs hit `m8-alpha.vercel.app` + cost Gemini quota — run deliberately; need explicit authorization.
- The nightly L5 attestation fires ~05:00 AST; with Build-36 the gate can now actually accumulate clean nights — watch the next few land + confirm the POST reaches `/api/loop-attest`.
- PS gotcha (bit us this session): `ConvertTo-Json` unwraps a single-element array → force the `attachments` JSON array by hand (see repro above).

## ✅ SESSION-36 (2026-06-15, Opus): FULL EPISTEMIC AXIS COMPLETE
- **Build-41 (`af8974f`)** + **Build-42 (`a5b6788`)** both SHIPPED + LIVE-VERIFIED. The honesty backbone
  is done: M8 reliably separates proven / guess / speculative, and handles fringe ideas without laundering
  them. Build-41 = neutral `speculative` bucket + schema edge-ban + Odysseus probe. Build-42 = kernel/leap
  split (real core vs speculative leap, two linked nodes, human-gated) + co-retrieval invariant. Specs
  `M8/BUILD_41_SPEC.md` + `M8/BUILD_42_SPEC.md`.
- **Decision (Muhammad, end of Session-36):** stop polishing honesty; turn toward USEFULNESS. Next session
  does the small search fix FIRST, then starts the big problem-solving engine.

## Kickoff prompt to paste into the next session
